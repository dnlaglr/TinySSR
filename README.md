# Tiny SSR - Lightweight React SSR
"Two things are infinite: the universe and the amount of JavaScript frameworks" - Albert Einstein 

## Project Information

### Motivation
While I've built several projects using server-side rendering, I didn't really understand how it worked under the hood. This project is meant to demistify the "black box" and give me a better understanding of how server-side rendering works.

### Features

### Built With
- [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) - Web framework
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Language used
- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) - Frontend UI library

## Roadmap
- [ ] Get basic SSR functionality
  - Process client requests
  - Fetch any necessary data
  - Dynamically generate html
- [ ] Implement path-based routing
  - Add sub-folder support
